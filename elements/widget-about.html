            Tomas Jonsgarden is an award-winning director and screenwriter with
            a background in music and still photography.
        </p>
        <p>
            After studying music at Uppsala University, and graduating from
            Stockholm Film School, Tomas began working as a director’s
            assistant. The desire to further grow his knowledge and aesthetic
            eye led to a job as a photographer’s assistant. After years as
            assistant Tomas began shooting advertising and editorial for hire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tomas’ ambition to direct commercials took a big leap forward when
            he got offered to start working as a director at the production
            company Forsberg & Co, in Stockholm 2001. It is here that Tomas
            began to hone in on his personal style through a variety of
            commercials and music videos.
        </p>
        <p>
            2004 marked the beginning of a successful collaboration with the
            producer Magnus Åkerstedt. Tomas and Magnus have been a
            director/producer team ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2007 Tomas was voted ”The Most Talented Commercial Director” in
            Sweden from both the major ad agencies and by a renowned
            ad-magazine. In the same year Tomas navigated through the tricky
            game of directing the high profile actor Richard Gere in a
            commercial. The collaboration was so successful that the superstar
            insisted Tomas to direct his next commercial project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, Tomas has made numerous high end commercials and short
            films and worked with several superstar actors through the years.
            Recently he made his long-form directorial debut for a Swedish
            TV-drama called MAFIA.
        </p>
        <p>
            His films take on a beautiful style of cinematic storytelling always
            with a human story at its core. He has a way of making everyday
            moments epic by capturing the subtle twitches of humanity that makes
            us laugh, cry or blush when we recognize ourselves in them. It takes
            a great director to imitate those gestures for the screen and it is
            something that has earned him awards at shows like Cannes Lions,
            British Arrows, Epica, Eurobest and New York Festivals amongst
            others.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023 Tomas was awarded ”Director of the year” at the Swedish ROY
            Awards.
